This project is meant to reinforce knowledge of JavaScript. It does so by practically applying knowledge of functions and variables, but also is a challenge to put proof to concept.
In this project, I created a simple code to play 5 rounds of "Rock, Paper, Scissors". The current project exists only in the console.
